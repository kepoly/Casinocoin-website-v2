	<h3>Dont know how Blockchain Tech Works?</h3>
	<p>So what is blockchain? The Casinocoin blockchain is the technology backbone of the network and provides a tamper-proof data structure, providing a shared public ledger open to all. The mathematics involved are impressive, and the use of specialized hardware to construct this vast chain of cryptographic data renders it practically impossible to replicate.</p>

<p>All confirmed transactions are embedded in the casinocoin blockchain. Use of SHA-256 cryptography ensures the integrity of the blockchain applications â€“ all transactions must be signed using a private key or seed, which prevents third parties from tampering with it. Transactions are confirmed by the network within a minutes up to only a few seconds. This process is handled by casinocoin miners, Mining is used to confirm transactions through a shared consensus system, and usually requires several independent confirmations for the transaction to go through. This process guarantees random distribution and makes tampering very difficult.</p>
